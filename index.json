[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Entrepreneur · AI Engineer · Data Scientist\nI am the Director of Artifical Intelligence and a co-founder at RIOS, where I build robots to autonomously perform tasks requiring advanced perception and human-level dexterity. A data scientist by education, I’ve developed an interest in applying modern methods of deep learning to machines that interact with the real world and ways to develop more generalized intelligence around automation.\nI have experience in areas such as computer vision tasks, reinforcement learning, time-series analysis and prediction, generative networks and evolution strategies. I am an advocate of open source and I welcome offers to get involved with projects that serve a greater good.\nIn past lives, I have been an entrepreneur, web developer, and graphic designer. I independently recorded and released an indie rock album under the moniker Alpha Leonis in 2009, have summited Mt. Hood twice, and am always looking for ways to reframe problems in search of blue oceans of opportunity.\n Download my resumé. --","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Entrepreneur · AI Engineer · Data Scientist\nI am the Director of Artifical Intelligence and a co-founder at RIOS, where I build robots to autonomously perform tasks requiring advanced perception and human-level dexterity.","tags":null,"title":"Matt Shaffer","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.
